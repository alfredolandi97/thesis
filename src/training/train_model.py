#      through scikit-learn 1.6.1's Tree.__setstate__, so every .fit() raises
#      "node array from the pickle has an incompatible dtype".
#   2. This project mutates tree_.threshold IN PLACE after fitting
#      (dt_thresholds_float_to_int, align_rf_thresholds). oneDAL keeps its own
#      internal model representation, so those mutations may not be observed --
#      which would silently invalidate every result rather than crash.

    Replaces a 7-tuple rather than growing it to twelve-plus positional
    values: a dataclass makes every caller name the field it reads instead of
    counting positions.

    model_A, model_B, stages, blocks, acc_sel_A, acc_sel_B, best_params are
    the original seven. The rest:

    rel_shortfall : the winning trial's balance shortfall from
        trial_selection.select_best_trial (spec B.3) -- how far the
        worse-served task fell below its own achievable best.
    n_trials_run : len(study.trials) -- how many trials the search actually
        ran before stopping (early stopping may cut this short of cfg.n_trials).
    n_feasible : how many of those trials satisfied both the codeword and
        block-budget constraints.
    align_attempted, align_accepted, intervals_before, intervals_after :
        the four align_stats keys from threshold_alignment.align_rf_thresholds,
        measured on the REFIT winner (gap 1), not an earlier trial. Alignment
        is a joint-arm-only treatment (fit_pair calls align_rf_thresholds only
        when encoding == 'joint' and cfg.alignment_enabled) -- on every other
        arm these four fields are None, deliberately NOT 0: a silent 0 would
        be indistinguishable from "alignment ran and accepted nothing", which
        is a real and different outcome. Task 8 writes '' into the CSV for
        the None case.

    Frozen so a ProcessPoolExecutor worker cannot mutate a result after it
    crosses the pickle boundary. Every field is plain data (numbers, a dict,
    or the two fitted models already returned pre-P5) so the whole thing
