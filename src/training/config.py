P4GenConfig is deliberately scoped to P4 generation (see its docstring), so

of TrainConfig values, and `arm_slug` is what makes a result file
self-describing: the arm cannot be misidentified from its artifact because the
filename is derived from the config that produced it.

    """Frozen so a ProcessPoolExecutor worker cannot mutate the arm it is
    running, which would silently mix two treatments into one output file.

    delta_align : SWEPT. Permitted relative-error degradation per task when a
        model is perturbed to make its thresholds shareable. None means
        accept-all (the "inf" anchor, which also skips the accuracy
        evaluation entirely). Applies to the JOINT arm only.
    alignment_enabled : False is the ablation arm -- align_rf_thresholds is not
        called at all, so the arm is provably prediction-identical to the
        unaligned models. This is NOT the same as delta_align = 0.
    delta_select : FIXED at 0.02 for every arm. How far the chosen trial may
        fall below the best achievable balance in exchange for fewer blocks.
        Not a treatment: it moves the baseline as well as the treatment, so
        sweeping it would shift the comparison under its own control variable.
        0.02 sits inside val_select's own standard error on both tasks
        (~0.007 on App = 3.2% of its error; ~0.0036 on DDoS = 9% of its
        error), so it only breaks ties that are not distinguishable.
    overlap_threshold : minimum overlap ratio for a range pair to be an
        alignment CANDIDATE -- a separate concern from whether a candidate is
        ACCEPTED (that is delta_align). Was hardcoded at the call site.
    n_trees, max_depth : inclusive search bounds -- per-axis and independent,
        so `rf_params` may suggest either maximum without suggesting both at
        once. No -1 sentinel (F10i). Rederived from the measured capacity
        ceiling rather than chosen by hand: `scripts/capacity_ceiling.py` fits
        both models over a n_trees x max_depth grid on 3 splits at the full
        feature set and records where the 512-bit codeword limit starts to
        bind, at both ends of rf_params' regularization ranges
        (results/capacity_ceiling.csv). A cell counts as feasible when ANY
        configuration the search can reach there compiles -- witnessed by the
        pruned corner, min_samples_leaf=200 / min_samples_split=400 -- and
        (11, 14) is the feasible cell with the largest reachable search space,
        ceil(n_trees / 2) * (max_depth - 1) = 78. The predecessor (7, 10) was
        a placeholder whose comment said P4 would derive it; nothing had
        measured the ceiling, which is what this replaces.
