"""P7b: the statistical claims layer (spec C.3).

Every number the results chapter states about the joint encoding comes
through this module. It consumes the frame contract documented in
`src/reporting/campaign_data.py` and turns it into five families of claim:

1. `pareto_front_3d` / `coverage_ratio_3d` -- is the joint arm's
   accuracy/accuracy/blocks trade-off surface better than the independent
   arm's?
2. `substitution_test` -- does either task pay for the other's gain?
3. `delta_frontier` -- how does each outcome move as the alignment
   tolerance delta is swept?
4. `ablation_decomposition` -- how much of the effect is the sharing
   constraint and how much is threshold alignment?
5. `paired_tests` -- are the accuracy claims survivable under a
   multiplicity correction?

Design decisions that a reader has to be able to audit
-----------------------------------------------------

**Why the front is 3-D.** The objectives are `(acc_app, acc_ddos, blocks)`
jointly, maximising the first two and minimising the third. Computing a 2-D
front per task independently would admit a point that is excellent on App
and terrible on DDoS -- exactly the trade this thesis exists to rule out.
`pareto_projections` exposes the three 2-D planes for plotting, but they are
PROJECTIONS of the 3-D front, never fronts recomputed inside a plane: a
projected point may look dominated in its plane and still belong on the
front, and hiding it would hide the trade.

**Why NaN is an error, not a filter.** Every NaN comparison is False, so a
NaN point is never dominated and would land on EVERY front. `load_campaign`
already drops infeasible rows (the only source of NaN accuracies in the
campaign), so this module should never see one -- which is precisely why it
raises instead of quietly dropping: a NaN arriving here means an upstream
invariant broke, and silently absorbing it would turn that break into a
plausible-looking wrong front.

**Why the Pareto relation is strict.** `a` dominates `b` iff `a` is no worse
on all three objectives and strictly better on at least one. Two identical
points therefore do not dominate each other and both stay on the front, and
`coverage_ratio_3d(A, A) == 0`. Zitzler's C metric is sometimes defined with
WEAK dominance, under which a set covers itself completely (C(A, A) == 1);
that convention makes "the joint arm covers X% of the independent arm's
front" unreadable when the two fronts share points, so the strict convention
is used here and `strict=False` is available for anyone who wants the other.

**Why one observation per split.** Replication in this campaign is at the
split level: every (M, k) cell inside one split was trained on the same data
split, so those cells are not independent observations. Wherever this module
forms a confidence interval it therefore aggregates to one number per split
first and puts the interval around the split-level mean, with a Student-t
quantile (not a normal one -- at 3-5 splits the difference is large). The
paired hypothesis tests are the deliberate exception, discussed below.

**One-sided versus two-sided.** Accuracy is tested one-sided and blocks
two-sided, and the two are not interchangeable:

* `acc_app`, `acc_ddos`: NO DETECTABLE LOSS. The alternative is
  `H1: median(joint - independent) > -margin`, i.e. `alternative='greater'`
  applied to `d + margin`. REJECTING H0 is the positive finding -- it says
  the joint arm is not worse by more than the margin. With the default
  `margin = 0` this reduces to `H1: median(d) > 0`: the joint arm shows no
  detectable loss against the baseline. That is deliberately NOT called
  non-inferiority, because non-inferiority is a claim against a
  pre-registered margin and no margin has been set; the word is used, in the
  emitted `hypothesis` column as well as here, only on the `margin > 0`
  branch, where it is earned. Reversing this to `alternative='less'` would
  test whether the joint arm IS worse, and reporting a large p-value from
  that as "no loss established" is a confident wrong answer, which is why
  `tests/test_claims.py` asserts the p-value in BOTH directions.
* `blocks`: two-sided. Sharing feature intervals could plausibly cost blocks
  as well as save them (alignment adds intervals before it merges any), so
  assuming a direction here would be assuming the result.

**The correction family, stated explicitly.** The arm grid
(`src/main.py`'s `PRIMARY_ARMS + SENSITIVITY_ARMS`) is one independent arm
plus seven joint arms. The pre-registered family is therefore

    7 contrasts   joint-off, joint-d000, joint-d002, joint-d005,
                  joint-d010, joint-d020, joint-dinf -- each against
                  `independent`
  x 3 tests       acc_app (one-sided), acc_ddos (one-sided),
                  blocks (two-sided)
  = 21 comparisons

`PRE_REGISTERED_FAMILY_SIZE` is that 21, `default_contrast_family` builds
those seven contrasts, and `paired_tests` reports `n_comparisons` on every
row so a reader can check the correction covered what was actually run.
Pass `expected_family_size=PRE_REGISTERED_FAMILY_SIZE` to make a shrunken
family (an arm missing from the frame) an error rather than a quietly weaker
correction. Holm-Bonferroni is applied across all 21 at once -- not per task,
not per arm.

**The substitution tests are a SECOND, SEPARATE family, and they are not
part of the 21.** `substitution_test` returns six p-value fields, and
`substitution_test_all_arms` runs it at all seven joint arms; taken raw that
is 42 uncorrected p-values and seven uncorrected decision flags, and under
the null at least one of seven flags at alpha = 0.05 fires roughly 30% of
the time. They are kept out of the pre-registered 21 deliberately -- folding
them in would dilute the Holm correction protecting the primary accuracy
claims with tests that answer a different question -- but
kept out is not the same as unreported, so:

* `substitution_test_all_arms` emits `pearson_p_negative_one_sided_holm`
  and `substitution_detected_holm`, Holm-corrected across the seven arms
  (`SUBSTITUTION_FAMILY_SIZE`), with `n_substitution_comparisons` recording
  how many arms actually yielded a defined test. Report the corrected flag.
* The other five p-value fields on each row stay uncorrected diagnostics
  and must be read as such.
* The correction direction here is self-penalising in a way the primary
  family is not: a false positive argues AGAINST the thesis, so an
  uncorrected flag errs towards over-reporting substitution rather than
  towards hiding it. That is a reason to read the flags carefully, not a
  reason to skip the correction.
* The same `(M, split, k)` dependence caveat that applies to
  `paired_tests` applies here: the correlations are computed over cells
  that share a training split within a split, so their p-values are
  anti-conservative relative to the number of independent splits.

`ablation_decomposition` deliberately reports NO p-values. Its two contrasts
(`joint-off - independent` and `joint-delta - joint-off`) are a descriptive
decomposition of where the effect comes from; adding tests there would
enlarge the multiplicity family without enlarging the claim, so it reports
effect sizes with split-level confidence intervals instead.

**Where the paired tests knowingly bend the independence assumption.** Spec
C.3 pairs on `(M, split, k)`, so `paired_tests` defaults to one paired
observation per cell (`unit='pair'`). Cells within a split share a training
split, so the effective sample size is smaller than `n_pairs` and the
p-values are anti-conservative. That is the spec's choice and the default
here, but `unit='split'` runs the same tests on one mean difference per
split -- valid under the split-level replication argument, at much lower
power -- as an available robustness check. Both `n_pairs` and `n_splits`
are reported on every row so the gap is visible.

**Libraries.** scipy only (`wilcoxon`, `pearsonr`, `spearmanr`, `rankdata`,
Student-t quantiles). statsmodels is not installed in this environment, so
Holm-Bonferroni and the partial correlation are implemented here; the test
suite checks Holm against a hand-computed table always, and against
`statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests` wherever statsmodels happens to
be importable.

`calculate_hypervolume_2d` (`analysis.py`) is deliberately NOT ported: its
reference point is arbitrary, a 3-D version would need two more arbitrary
coordinates, and `coverage_ratio_3d` answers the same question without one.

       the module docstring for why they are kept separate). Under the null,
       at least one of seven raw flags fires roughly 30% of the time. Prefer
       `substitution_test_all_arms`, which adds a Holm-corrected flag across
       the seven arms.
    2. The pairs are `(M, split, k)` cells, and cells inside one split share
       a training split, so they are not independent observations. The
       effective sample size is smaller than `n_pairs` and the p-values are
       anti-conservative -- the same caveat `paired_tests` carries.
       `n_splits` is returned alongside `n_pairs` so the gap is visible.

    Run at every arm rather than only at the largest delta because the claim
    being defended is "no task sacrifices itself for the other at ANY
    tolerance"; testing only the extreme would leave the interesting middle
    of the sweep unexamined. Arms absent from `df` are skipped, so a partial
    campaign still produces a table.

    THIS IS A SEPARATE FAMILY FROM THE PRE-REGISTERED 21. Running one
    one-sided test per arm means seven decision flags, and at alpha = 0.05
    at least one fires under the null roughly 30% of the time, so the raw
    `substitution_detected` must not be read across the sweep as if it were
    a single test. Two extra columns fix that:

    * `pearson_p_negative_one_sided_holm` -- the flag-driving p-value,
      Holm-corrected across the arms in THIS table only. It is deliberately
      not pooled with `paired_tests`' 21: folding a different question into
      that family would dilute the correction protecting the primary
      accuracy claims.
    * `substitution_detected_holm` -- the corrected decision. Report this
      one; `substitution_detected` is kept alongside as the uncorrected
      per-arm result, not as a second opinion.

    `n_substitution_comparisons` records how many arms yielded a DEFINED
    test and were therefore corrected over: an arm whose deltas were
    constant produced no test at all (NaN, not a null result), so including
    it would inflate the family with a comparison nobody ran. That count is
    `SUBSTITUTION_FAMILY_SIZE` on a complete campaign.

    The `(M, split, k)` dependence caveat from `substitution_test` applies to
    every p-value here, corrected or not: cells inside a split share a
    training split, so these p-values are anti-conservative relative to the
    number of independent splits.

    three tests -- `acc_app`, `acc_ddos`, `blocks` -- for 21 comparisons.
    Holm-Bonferroni is applied across ALL of them at once; `n_comparisons` on

    `expected_family_size=PRE_REGISTERED_FAMILY_SIZE` turns a shrunken family
    (an arm missing from `df`) into an error rather than a quietly weaker

    Which alternative each test encodes -- the expensive thing to get wrong:

    * `acc_app`, `acc_ddos`: ONE-SIDED, `alternative='greater'` applied to
      `d + margin` where `d = joint - independent`. The null is
      `median(d) <= -margin` and the alternative is `median(d) > -margin`, so
      a SMALL p-value is the positive finding: the joint arm is not worse by
      more than `margin`. With the default `margin = 0` this is
      `H1: median(d) > 0` -- NO DETECTABLE LOSS, which is what the emitted
      `hypothesis` column says at that default. It is not called
      non-inferiority there: non-inferiority is a claim against a
      pre-registered margin, and `margin = 0` sets none. Pass `margin > 0`
      and the column says non-inferiority and names the margin. Reversing the
      test to `alternative='less'` would ask whether the joint arm IS worse,
      and a large p-value from that establishes nothing.
    * `blocks`: TWO-SIDED. Alignment adds intervals before it merges any, so
      sharing can cost blocks as well as save them and no direction may be
      assumed. `margin` is not applied to `blocks`.

    `unit='pair'` (default) tests one difference per `(M, split, k)` cell, as
    spec C.3 pairs; those cells share a training split within a split, so the
    p-values are anti-conservative relative to the number of independent
    splits. `unit='split'` collapses each split to its mean difference first
    -- valid under split-level replication, far less powerful -- as a
    robustness check. Both `n_pairs` and `n_splits` are always reported.
