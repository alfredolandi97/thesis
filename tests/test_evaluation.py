# iteration order (generate_codewords appends '*' at build_p4_script.py:
# 368/375, and narrows a leaf-tested feature's segment to a run of '0's
# followed by a run of '1's). A feature the leaf's path never tests gets its
# *entire* segment wildcarded, and that segment has exactly
# len(feature_intervals[feature]) reachable values (one per position of the
# 0/1 boundary) -- NOT 2**width independent bit choices. The two only

# using only width-1 features can't catch a width > 1 miscount; the fixtures

# (Sec 4.2), so nibble_widths_for() raises instead of pricing it.
